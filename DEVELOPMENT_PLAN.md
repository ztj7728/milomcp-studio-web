## Key Components Architecture

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Login flow with token refresh
User Login → JWT Access Token (15min) + Refresh Token (30d)
→ Store in secure HTTP-only cookies
→ Auto-refresh on token expiry
→ Logout revokes all tokens
```

### State Management Structure
```typescript
// Zustand stores
- authStore: user session, tokens, permissions, role (admin/user)
- toolStore: available tools, user-specific execution history, permission checks
- workspaceStore: user-isolated files, current workspace state, quotas
- uiStore: user-specific theme, sidebar state, notifications
- adminStore: admin-only features, user management, system-wide monitoring
```

### API Integration Patterns
```typescript
// React Query patterns
- Queries: GET operations with caching
- Mutations: POST/PUT/DELETE with optimistic updates
- Real-time: WebSocket integration with query invalidation
- Error handling: Centralized error boundary system
```

## Security Considerations

### Client-Side Security
- [ ] Secure token storage (HTTP-only cookies)
- [ ] CSRF protection
- [ ] XSS prevention
- [ ] Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Secure environment variable handling

### API Security
- [ ] Request/response validation with Zod
- [ ] Rate limiting awareness (per-user and global)
- [ ] Proper error message handling (avoid leaking user data)
- [ ] File upload security (user-isolated storage)
- [ ] Strict user permission enforcement and role-based access control
- [ ] User data isolation validation (prevent cross-user data access)
- [ ] Admin privilege escalation protection

## Performance Optimization

### Core Web Vitals
- [ ] Code splitting with Next.js
- [ ] Image optimization
- [ ] Font optimization
- [ ] Bundle size optimization
- [ ] Lazy loading for heavy components

### Multi-User Caching Strategy
- [ ] React Query caching configuration with user-scoped cache keys
- [ ] Static asset caching (shared across users)
- [ ] API response caching with user isolation (prevent cache poisoning)
- [ ] User-specific data invalidation strategies
- [ ] Service Worker implementation with user context (future)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Component testing with Jest/React Testing Library
- [ ] Hook testing
- [ ] Utility function testing
- [ ] API client testing

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Multi-user authentication flow testing
- [ ] Role-based API integration testing (admin vs user permissions)
- [ ] User-isolated data access testing
- [ ] Form submission testing with user context
- [ ] Navigation testing with role-based restrictions
- [ ] Cross-user data isolation verification

### E2E Testing (Future)
- [ ] Playwright setup with multi-user test scenarios
- [ ] Critical user journey testing (admin and regular user flows)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing with different user roles
- [ ] User isolation testing (verify users cannot access each other's data)
- [ ] Admin privilege testing (verify admin-only features work correctly)

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- [ ] Local development setup
- [ ] Hot reloading configuration
- [ ] Development API proxy
- [ ] Environment variable management

### Production Deployment
